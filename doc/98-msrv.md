## Minimal Supported Rust Version (MSRV), syntax support and stability

_`expandable` supports Rust 1.65 and above. Bumping the MSRV is
considered a breaking change._

Note that the embedded parser will support syntax that was introduced
_after_ Rust 1.65.

Adding support for newer syntax is _not_ considered a breaking change.

The error messages generated by `expandable` are not stable and may change
without notice.

Any change that may trigger errors on previously accepted code is considered
a breaking change.
