## Minimal Supported Rust Version (MSRV), syntax support and stability

_`expandable` currently supports Rust 1.70 and above. Bumping the MSRV is not
considered a breaking change. If you believe this is an issue, then consider
funding this crate's development and maintenance. Send a mail to sasha `dot`
pourcelot `at` protonmail `dot` com for more info._

Note that the embedded parser will support syntax that was introduced
_after_ Rust 1.70.

Adding support for newer syntax is _not_ considered a breaking change.

The error messages generated by `expandable` are not stable and may change
without notice.

Any change that may trigger errors on previously accepted code is considered
a breaking change.
